    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A simple Bolognese recipe for excellent chunky pasta sauce with beef, pork, lots of vegetables, and tons of flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, minced</li>   
        <li>4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</li>     
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>   
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>   
        <li> ½ pound ground pork</li>      
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can Italian plum tomatoes</li>    
        <li>½ pound fresh mushrooms, sliced</li>     
        <li>6 ounces tomato sauce</li>       
        <li>2 carrots, shredded</li>      
        <li>1 stalk celery, chopped</li>    
        <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>       
        <li>½ cup chicken stock</li>       
        <li>½ teaspoon dried basil</li>     
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>      
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>   
        <li>1 pound pasta</li>   
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Warm oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Sauté onion, bacon, and garlic in hot oil until bacon is browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer bacon mixture to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.</li>
        <li>Place the same large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef and pork in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.</li>
        <li>Stir bacon mixture, tomatoes, mushrooms, tomato sauce, carrots, celery, wine, stock, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper into meat mixture. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer sauce for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook in boiling water until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Serve sauce over hot pasta.</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Jollof Rice</h1>
    <img alt="A plate of jollof rice" src="../images/jollof.png">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Jollof rice is a staple in West African cuisine. It’s made from rice, tomatoes, onions, peppers, and other seasonings.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The main ingredient in jollof rice is, of course, rice.</li>
        <li>Next up are the canned tomato, fresh tomatoes, bell peppers, scotch bonnet, onions, garlic, and ginger—each of which adds a unique flavor and texture to your dish!</li>
        <li>You’ll also need oil for frying your sauce—any kind of vegetable oil will do.</li>
        <li>Stock—Chicken, beef, or vegetable stock are great choices here for adding depth of flavor.</li>
        <li>And lastly, there’s the seasoning and herbs—curry powder, salt, black/white pepper, bouillon powder, thyme, and bay leaves.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The inevitable foundation for building up the flavor in this meal is to start by sauteeing the Onions. This should take about 3 to 5 minutes. The next thing is to stir in the tomato paste. This adds a deep and rich tomato flavor; I simply fry this for another 5 minutes or thereabout.</li>
        <li>Add the ginger and garlic and cook along with the tomato paste for another two minutes; Actually, by the time this is ready, you will notice it in the smell. If you keep it cooking any longer, you might risk burning them.</li>
        <li>Add the blended peppers. Usually, there is no particular time frame for frying this pepper. I often stop when the sauce becomes really thick, and the oil literally floats on top of the sauce. At this point, most of the water is gone, and the sauce no longer smells raw. Trust me, you will know, but just in case you are still in doubt, I would say maybe 15 to 20 minutes depending on the quantity of water in your blended pepper</li>
        <li>Finally, in building my flavor, I add the thyme, curry powder, salt, white pepper (good but optional), and seasoning cubes. Adjust the seasoning at this point if there is a need to.</li>
        <li>Once the flavor is on point, then, I stir in the Rice. Make sure you stir the rice properly until you cover each grain of rice with the sauce.</li>
        <li>Now add the chicken stock. Give it a brief stir and cover it up with a tight-fitting lid. If your lid is not fitting enough, simply cover the rice with foil paper before covering it with the lid. This is because Jollof needs a lot of steam in order to turn out well.</li>
        <li>Once the rice comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low immediately and continue to cook until the rice is done, about 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve with Fried Chicken, Spicy Grilled Chicken, Grilled Tilapia Fish, or Gizzards and plantains.</li>
    </ol>
